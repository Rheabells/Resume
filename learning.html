        <h2>Skills and Learning</h2>
        <p>I am still on my journey of mastering coding and web development, but I am incredibly motivated to keep improving every day. While I may not be a coding expert just yet, I am continuously learning and applying new concepts to the best of my ability.</p>
        <p>Some of the key skills I’ve gained so far include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>HTML</strong>: I am familiar with creating web pages and structuring content using semantic HTML tags.</li>
          <li><strong>CSS</strong>: I can design responsive layouts and implement basic styling, though I still experiment with advanced features like animations and grid layouts.</li>
          <li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: I’ve begun learning how to make websites interactive with JavaScript, and I’m working on understanding how to manipulate the DOM and work with APIs.</li>
          <li><strong>Version Control (Git)</strong>: I’ve started using Git for version control to manage my projects and collaborate with others.</li>
          <li><strong>Responsive Web Design</strong>: I am learning to make websites that work well on all screen sizes, ensuring accessibility and usability.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Although I am not yet a master of these technologies, I am committed to growing my skills through hands-on projects, tutorials, and continuous practice. I am eager to tackle real-world challenges and contribute to exciting web development projects.</p>
